                        through your APTECH88 account by clicking on My Account > Responsible Gaming and using the tool
                        in
                        the section titled “Deposit Limit” where you should enter your preferred Daily Deposit Limit

                    <p>If you have set a deposit limit and now wish to reduce the deposit limit, you can do so
                        immediately. Please note that you will be excluded from depositing any funds when your deposit
                        limit is set to zero (0). Should you wish to increase or remove a deposit limit; a 24 hour
                        cooling-off period will be applied from the latest time stamp indicated in the Deposit Limit
                        settings. Any increase or removal will then only take effect after you have accessed your
                        account to confirm that the request is still required.</p>
